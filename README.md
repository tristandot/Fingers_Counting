# Finger Recognition and Counting Project


A very simple MatLab project, initially developped in order to count the number of fingers shown by someone on a picture (with more work, it could be used to recognize simple human gestures on photographs).

Some of the Image Processing techniques used are: HSV Representation, Top-Hat Transform, K-means algorithm (in order to find the best treshold in skin-detection), and Hough Transform.

Here is a simple step-by-step example of the results:
